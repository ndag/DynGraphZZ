# Zigzag Persistent Homology for Dynamic Graphs

The code in this repository works to 
1. Generate dynamic graph files from dynamic metric spaces
2. Compute the zigzag persistent homology of dynamic graphs and bottleneck distances between persistence barcodes

-discuss theory and reference origin paper, consider naming of things due to faces/2-simplices being allowed consideration.

The code is authored by [Nate Clause](https://math.osu.edu/people/clause.15), a Math Ph.D. student at Ohio State, with contributions by [Facundo MÃ©moli](https://people.math.osu.edu/memolitechera.1/).

**"graph_generator.py"** generates a "graph file", which consists of information regarding when nodes, edges, and faces appear in a dynamic (graph?) . The code is run from the command line as follows: 

```
python graph_generator.py [infile] [outfile] [num_points] [threshold] 
```

infile is the filename of the dynamic location data file, which contains a series of locations of points through time, with one point per line. outfile is the name of the file to which the program will write out the dynamic graph information. num_points represents the number of points through constained in the dynamic location data file. Points in the location data file need to be consistently ordered for the code to work properly. For example, if there are 40 points total over 1000 timesteps, then the dynamic location data file will be 40000 lines long. If we label the points 1 through 40, then point 1 should have its location data at timestep t, ranging from 1 to 1000, in line 40(t-1)+1, point 2 should have its location data at timestep t in line 40(t-1)+2, and so on. 

The code currently assumes the points are in Euclidean space and computes the Euclidean distance between them. To change this, one would need to substitute every instance of "pdist" in the file with whatever distance method they wish to use. If your data is already in the form of a time series of distance matrices, than you can remove everything in the code regarding reading in points and computing distances and directly read in the file with the time series of distance matrices into the variable "dists" inside the "generate_graph" function.

The code determines if a node, edge, or face should appear based on the Vietoris-Rips complex at scale parameter [threshold]. This means a 0, 1, or 2-simplex S will apear at timestep t if the diameter of S is less than or equal to the input threshold parameter.

**"zz_bottleneck.py"** computes the persistence barcodes found when applying zigzag persistent homology filtering a dynamic graph file through time with a fixed threshold parameter for the Vietoris-Rips complex as described above. It also computes the bottleneck distance in 0 and 1-dimensions between these persistence barcodes. The code is run from the command line as follows:

```
python zz_bottleneck.py [filename1] [filename2] 
```

Where filename1 and filename2 are two files which are outputs of the graph_generator.py code.
